# CRIA Auto-Suggestion Demo Guide

## Multi-Word Auto-Suggestion Features

The CRIA application now supports intelligent multi-word auto-suggestions for labels and projects with enhanced matching capabilities and automatic bracket wrapping.

## How to Use

### 1. Quick Add Modal (`a` key)
Open the quick add modal and try these examples:

#### Label Suggestions (use `*` prefix):
```
Buy groceries *shopping           # Suggests labels like "shopping list", "shopping mall"  
Finish report *work pro           # Suggests labels like "work project", "work progress"
*web                             # Shows all labels starting with "web"
*mobile dev                      # Matches "mobile development" 
```

When you select a multi-word suggestion, it will automatically be wrapped in square brackets:
- Typing `*home` and selecting "Home Maintenance" → `*[Home Maintenance]`

#### Project Suggestions (use `+` prefix):
```
Review code +work                # Suggests projects like "work tasks", "work projects"
Plan meeting +client             # Suggests projects like "client alpha", "client beta"  
+personal proj                   # Matches "personal projects"
```

When you select a multi-word suggestion, it will automatically be wrapped in square brackets:
- Typing `+plan` and selecting "Planning a Roadtrip" → `+[Planning a Roadtrip]`

### 2. Edit Modal (`e` key on selected task)
Same functionality works in the edit modal when modifying existing tasks.

### 3. Navigation Controls
- **↑/↓ Arrow Keys**: Navigate through suggestions
- **Tab or Enter**: Accept selected suggestion (auto-wraps multi-word items in `[]`)
- **Esc**: Cancel suggestions and return to normal input
- **Continue Typing**: Refine suggestions in real-time

## Supported Syntax for Multi-Word Items

The parser now supports multiple delimiters for multi-word labels and projects:

### Labels:
- `*label` - Single word label
- `*"label with spaces"` - Quoted label (traditional)
- `*'label with spaces'` - Single-quoted label
- `*[label with spaces]` - Bracket-wrapped label (auto-generated by suggestions)

### Projects:
- `+project` - Single word project
- `+"project with spaces"` - Quoted project (traditional)  
- `+'project with spaces'` - Single-quoted project
- `+[project with spaces]` - Bracket-wrapped project (auto-generated by suggestions)

## Matching Strategies

### 1. Exact Prefix Match
- `*web` → matches labels starting with "web"
- `+work` → matches projects starting with "work"

### 2. Word-Boundary Match
- `*web dev` → matches "web development" (each word matches start of label words)
- `+my proj task` → matches "my project tasks"

### 3. Substring Match
- `*mobile` → matches any label containing "mobile" 
- `+client` → matches any project containing "client"

## Example Workflow

1. Press `a` to open quick add modal
2. Type: `Review PR *code review +work proj`
3. When typing `*code`, suggestions appear for labels
4. Use ↑/↓ to select "code review" and press Tab → becomes `*[code review]`
5. When typing `+work`, suggestions appear for projects  
6. Use ↑/↓ to select "work projects" and press Tab → becomes `+[work projects]`
7. Final text: `Review PR *[code review] +[work projects]`
8. Press Enter to create the task

## Magic Syntax Support

The auto-suggestions work seamlessly with the existing magic syntax:
- `*label` or `*[multi word label]` - Labels
- `+project` or `+[multi word project]` - Projects  
- `@user` or `@[user name]` - Assignees
- `!priority` - Priority (1-5)
- `^star` - Mark as favorite
- `YYYY-MM-DD` - Due dates

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Multi-word labels/projects**: Let the auto-suggestion system handle the brackets automatically
2. **Manual entry**: You can type `*[label name]`, `*"label name"`, or `*'label name'` manually
3. **Partial words**: You can type partial words and the system will find matches
4. **Case insensitive**: All matching is case-insensitive
5. **Real-time filtering**: Suggestions update as you type
6. **Bracket handling**: Square brackets are automatically added for multi-word suggestions

# Undo/Redo System Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the comprehensive undo/redo system implementation for CRIA, a Terminal User Interface for Vikunja task management.

## Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
✅ **Undo Stack**: Maintains a history of up to 50 undoable actions
✅ **Redo Stack**: Maintains a history of up to 50 redoable actions  
✅ **Keyboard Shortcuts**: 
  - `Ctrl+Z` - Undo last action
  - `Ctrl+Y` - Redo last undone action
✅ **Visual Feedback**: Debug messages show undo/redo operation results
✅ **Modal Support**: Undo/redo works within modals (Quick Add, Edit)
✅ **Stack Management**: Automatic cleanup and size limits

### Supported Actions
✅ **Task Completion Toggle**: Undo/redo task done state changes
✅ **Task Deletion**: Undo/redo task deletion with position restoration
✅ **Task Creation**: Undo/redo newly created tasks
✅ **Task Editing**: Undo/redo task property changes

### Technical Implementation

#### Data Structures
- `UndoableAction` enum with variants:
  - `TaskCompletion { task_id: i64, previous_state: bool }`
  - `TaskDeletion { task: Task, position: usize }`
  - `TaskCreation { task_id: i64 }`
  - `TaskEdit { task_id: i64, previous_task: Task }`

#### Key Components
- **App State** (`src/tui/app/state.rs`):
  - `undo_stack: Vec<UndoableAction>` - Stores actions that can be undone
  - `redo_stack: Vec<UndoableAction>` - Stores actions that can be redone

- **Task Operations** (`src/tui/app/tasks.rs`):
  - `undo_last_action()` - Pops from undo stack, applies reverse action
  - `redo_last_action()` - Pops from redo stack, applies forward action
  - `add_to_undo_stack()` - Adds action to undo stack, clears redo stack

- **Key Handling** (`src/main.rs`):
  - Main event loop handles `Ctrl+Z` and `Ctrl+Y`
  - Modal handlers support undo/redo within modals

#### Stack Management
- **Size Limits**: Both stacks limited to 50 items (configurable)
- **Automatic Cleanup**: When limit reached, oldest items are removed
- **State Coherence**: New actions clear the redo stack to maintain consistency

### User Experience

#### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Global**: `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` work in main task view
- **Modal**: `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` work within Quick Add and Edit modals
- **Visual Feedback**: Debug messages confirm undo/redo success or failure

#### Behavior
- **Intuitive**: Standard undo/redo behavior familiar to users
- **Reliable**: Handles edge cases like missing tasks gracefully
- **Efficient**: Minimal performance impact with bounded stack sizes

### Testing

#### Test Coverage
✅ **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test suite in `tests/undo_redo.rs`
✅ **Integration Tests**: Modal integration tests in `tests/modals.rs`
✅ **Edge Cases**: Error handling, missing tasks, empty stacks
✅ **Stack Limits**: Verification of 50-item limits
✅ **State Consistency**: Verification of stack coherence

#### Test Results
```
Running tests/undo_redo.rs
running 8 tests
test test_task_completion_undo_redo ... ok
test test_task_deletion_undo_redo ... ok
test test_task_edit_undo_redo ... ok
test test_multiple_undo_redo_sequence ... ok
test test_undo_redo_task_creation ... ok
test test_undo_redo_empty_stacks ... ok
test test_undo_redo_clears_opposite_stack ... ok
test test_undo_redo_with_task_deletion_and_restoration ... ok

test result: ok. 8 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Undo/Redo
1. Mark a task as complete with `d`
2. Undo the completion with `Ctrl+Z`
3. Redo the completion with `Ctrl+Y`

### Task Deletion
1. Delete a task with `D` → `Enter` (confirm)
2. Undo deletion with `Ctrl+Z` (task is restored at original position)
3. Redo deletion with `Ctrl+Y` (task is removed again)

### Within Modals
1. Open Quick Add modal with `a`
2. Type some text
3. Use `Ctrl+Z` to undo previous actions
4. Use `Ctrl+Y` to redo undone actions

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- **Granular Undo**: Support for undoing individual character edits
- **Undo History UI**: Visual representation of undo/redo history
- **Batch Operations**: Support for undoing/redoing multiple actions at once
- **Persistent Undo**: Save undo history across application restarts
- **Configurable Limits**: User-configurable undo stack size

### Performance Optimizations
- **Memory Efficiency**: Compress or limit stored task data
- **Smart Cleanup**: More intelligent stack management
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Defer expensive operations until needed

## Architecture Notes

### Design Decisions
- **Enum-Based Actions**: Type-safe representation of undoable operations
- **Bounded Stacks**: Prevent memory bloat with configurable limits
- **Immutable State**: Store complete previous states for reliability
- **Clear Semantics**: New actions clear redo stack for predictable behavior

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Missing tasks don't crash the application
- **User Feedback**: Clear messages for successful/failed operations
- **State Consistency**: Maintain valid state even when operations fail

## Conclusion

The undo/redo system provides a robust, user-friendly way to reverse and replay actions in CRIA. With comprehensive testing, intuitive keyboard shortcuts, and support for both main view and modal operations, it enhances the overall user experience while maintaining code quality and reliability.

The implementation follows industry best practices with bounded stacks, type-safe operations, and comprehensive error handling. The system is designed to be extensible for future enhancements while maintaining backward compatibility.

### üîß Technical Improvements

#### Architecture Refactoring
- Split monolithic files into focused modules:
  - `tui/ui/` - UI rendering components
  - `tui/app/` - Application state and domain logic
  - `tui/modals/` - Modal event handlers
  - `tui/pickers/` - Picker event handlers
  - `vikunja_client/` - API client by resource type

#### Code Quality
- **Event handling refactor** - Dedicated handlers for each modal and picker type
- **Utility centralization** - Common functions in `tui/utils.rs`
- **Error handling** - Robust error handling throughout the application
- **Memory safety** - Leveraging Rust's ownership system for reliability
